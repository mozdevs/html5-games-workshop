We are going to create a classic **one-screen platformer** game! It will feature a main character, who can run and jump to platforms. There will also be enemies that this character will have to avoid –or kill! The goal of the game is to fetch the key and open the door that leads to the next level.

You can [play the game here](/platformer/).

We will be implementing the following game development concepts:

- **Loading** assets.
- Handling **game states**.
- Rendering **images** on the screen.
- Implementing **sprites**.
- Reading the player's input via **keyboard**.
- Using a **physics engine** to move sprites and handle **collisions**.
- Writing **text** with a bitmap font.
- Playing **sound** effects and background music.

We will focus on game development concepts and the Phaser API in a way that is accessible to as many people as possible. This means that some good practises, like modules, that require of additional tools or a better understanding of JavaScript will _not_ be seen here.

That said, if _you_ are familiar with this tools/concepts and want to use them in this workshop, by all means, do it.

## Important!

This guide uses [Phaser CE version **2.7.7**](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser-ce/). This version is what it's included in the project template provided in the next step.

It is possible that later on some changes in Phaser API in future versions might make this guide not 100% compatible with the latest Phaser version. We will try to keep this updated, though.

## About the art assets
